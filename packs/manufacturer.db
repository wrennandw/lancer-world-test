Operating in a gray legal state between harmless omninet communes, open-source fabrication collaboratives, black-market printers, and deeper, more esoteric collectives, HORUS is counted among the Big Four not due to its influence on galactic politics, but because of its ubiquitous coverage: one can be certain that wherever there is omninet, HORUS is either there or soon to follow. Rumors abound as to the manufacturer’s nature – some say it’s the dream of an unshackled NHP or a hacker collective dedicated to open-source manufacturing (at its most mundane levels); others insist that it’s the proving ground for one of the corpro-states’ R&D departments, or the realspace projection of an alien entity’s ongoing wish.<br><br>The group’s history is as mercurial as its present. Union records dating back to the First Committee Period indicate contact with groups, individuals, and state actors claiming to be (or identified as) agents of HORUS, itself described as an individual; a terrorist group; a philosophy church, or political party; an activist group; and many other forms of association. Contemporary reports indicate a subtle shift toward a more cohesive organizing structure – certainly accelerated following the Deimos Event – that points to some form of organizational mission and internal culture at levels far beyond the civilian and criminal levels of engagement with grayspace HORUS fronts.<br><br>This more complex level of organization is reflected in HORUS’s mechs. Unlike the collective’s broad, civilian-facing projects – omnicode, hacks, data, and open-sourcing of otherwise restricted information, services, and platforms – HORUS mechs and pattern groups are limited in the extreme, usually first appearing as endemic manifestations of print anomalies in conflict zones across the galaxy. Save for rare situations (heavily documented by the Union Intelligence Bureau), these outbreaks seem to take place independent and ignorant of all factions and actors, and have one goal: manifest, then proliferate.<br><br>HORUS’s oldest frames are built according to standardized forms, as with most other mechs. The collective’s more recent chassis are stranger. Union’s Universal Threat Assessment Manual (UTAM) classifies them not according to models but according to “pattern groups” (or PGs). Each pattern group is a list of specifications that describe a particular combination of experimental, unregulated, and esoteric paracausal weapons and technology that, when taken together, resemble something like a distinct product line or frame. However, it is important to note: the pattern-group classification system originated with Union analysts, not HORUS. Because there is no official manufacturer-entity or (known) central organizing body, the “proper” designations and design intentions of most HORUS mechs are all but unknown. Thus, the UTAM pattern-group designations.<br><br>HORUS “licenses” are highly coveted, and are distributed according to no discernible requirements; scholars and specialists who study HORUS generally assume that the collective’s licenses – that is, access to deep-level designs, specifications, and print patterns – are available only in limited quantities, likely becoming available after the corporeal death of their previous holders.<br><br>HORUS mechs universally field mysterious, unregulated, greyspace technologies – perfect for pilots seeking a technological edge that few other organizations can provide. They seem to focus on crowd control, individual unit management, and terribly powerful systems.<br><br>Be aware that by seeking out HORUS technology, you may find yourself wrapped up in mysteries with no end, and dangers far beyond your deepest fears.","dark":"#00a256","quote":"<code class='horus'>[CONGRATULATIONS, PILOT.<br>\t\tYOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.<br>\tACCESS IS YOURS,<br>\t  AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP IT.]</code>","logo_url":""},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"kpZ1DNCgd1F5Mepo":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"lancer","systemVersion":"1.6.1","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1690825079205,"modifiedTime":1690825079205,"lastModifiedBy":"kpZ1DNCgd1F5Mepo"},"_id":"PYRfoXbYrGRn1Oat"}

Founded by Cartwright Smith and Shimano Hideyoshi, SSC’s emphasis on private stellar and interstellar travel, the fantastic wealth of its founders, and favorable contracts within Union’s First Committee, Smith-Shimano quickly became an early leader in the race to develop sublight, downwell, and EVA vehicles. SSC grew throughout Union’s First Expansion Period, managing the majority of all private and corporate contracts’ design, outfitting, and clinical needs. Over time, the corporation diversified to specialize in bio-bespoke, long-range scout suits – personalized hard suits, for those with the manna to afford them.<br><br>The necessities of deep-space exploration require humans to spend long periods in hostile environments; pre-Deimos Event, SSC sought to address this challenge by breaking down the barriers between human and machine, creating a symbiotic relationship between hardsuit and wearer. Following the Deimos Event, however, SSC wound down most of its human/machine integration research in accordance with the First Contact Accords, choosing instead to focus on perfecting the first machine: the human body itself.<br><br>Smith-Shimano Frames reflect the corpro-state’s pedigree and its agile, adaptable business model. They are built not to take hits – though they’re resilient enough – but to avoid them entirely. SSC designs emphasize mobility and sleek profiles, precisely tuned to land not the hardest hit, but the most accurate. Economy, precision, and singularity is the name of the game for this manufacturer: why fire a thousand rounds when one can be just as effective?<br><br>The mechs developed by SSC are known for their license exclusivity, appealing silhouette, and exacting design. Their LUX-Iconic line of chassis are coveted, single-designer models, each unique to the pilot with the requisite licenses and access to afford them; as such, unlike other manufacturers, SSC frames tend to be longer-lasting in service, with more emphasis on retrofitting and repair than recycling and reproduction.","dark":"#d1920a","quote":"<i>You only need one.</i>","logo_url":""},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"kpZ1DNCgd1F5Mepo":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"lancer","systemVersion":"1.6.1","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1690825079202,"modifiedTime":1690825079202,"lastModifiedBy":"kpZ1DNCgd1F5Mepo"},"_id":"Rz0HjUx0C9hVdf3H"}

Reliable, sturdy, solidly built, and available in countless localized patterns, there are so many variants on the Everest pattern that it has become totally ubiquitous and faded into the background. With universally compatible components, full radiation and environmental shielding, and tens of thousands of pre-loaded languages, a pilot in their Everest has everything they need to get the job done.<br><br>GMS is one of the oldest fabricators in the galaxy, first getting its start in the early days of the colonization rush. The manufacturer hails from Cradle, the home of Union – and humanity – and thus its designs reflect the sensibilities of the first pioneers to seek the stars. Today, GMS products are available anywhere there is access to the omninet. These products, whether consumer, specialty, or military, are widely viewed as the galactic minimum of quality: not particularly luxurious, but unsurpassed in no-nonsense design, reliability, and ease of use.

The resulting firm, IPS-N is a titanic entity – one of the first corpro-states – with a virtual monopoly over interplanetary and interstellar shipping. Other firms exist, but their gross fleet strength is but a shadow of IPS-N’s fleets of tankers, haulers, freighters, and intergate/interstellar liners. Wherever goods and raw materials need to be moved, you can bet a crew in IPS-N uniforms will be there.<br><br>The story of IPS-N is inseparable from the history of interstellar piracy. Whatever dangers the galaxy might hold, piracy remains the greatest threat to interstellar shipping lines, costing fleet managers and states hundreds of thousands in manna and trillions more in local currencies. Tremendous capital losses, schedule delays, losses of life, and false-scarcity famines convinced the myriad unions, conglomerates, and cartels of the need to comprehensively safeguard civilian shipping. A process of agglomeration and consolidation that lasted for years eventually gave birth to two major firms, Interplanetary Shipping and Northstar. They finally merged into a single corpro-state in the waning days of Union’s first government, the First Committee.<br><br>Following the merger, IPS-N began the work of phasing out its fleets of late-model GMS mechs in favor of new proprietary designs. The corporation now sports a range of versatile, durable, and modular mechs that place equal priority on weapons and engineering systems. IPS-N mechs are a good choice for pilots who want a tough chassis that’s built for close quarters and melee combat situations, such as when the possibility of breaching a ship hull is on the table.
